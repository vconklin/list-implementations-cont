# Practice Together

Refreshers from last assignment
+ Let's take a look at `array-list.rb` and `linked-list.rb`. Note that I've included her my solutions and I've also moved the testing stuff out into `test-array-list.rb` and `test-linked-list.rb`
+ Let's talk about how `delete` works in `linked-list.rb`
+ Let's look at the efficiency of the methods we wrote in `linked-list.rb`, particularly `size`

New
+ Look at `lotto.rb` and talk about interfaces vs implementations

# Assignment

  + Add a method `sort` to `array-list.rb`
  + Add a method `sort` to `linked-list.rb`
